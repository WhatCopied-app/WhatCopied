## Why WhatCopied

Apple provides a developer tool called **Clipboard Viewer**, included in the "Xcode Additional Tools", which you can download [here](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=Additional%20Tools).

It works well but has some limitations. Here's how **WhatCopied** improves upon the official Clipboard Viewer:

- [x] Unicode support
- [x] Modern UI with dark mode
- [x] Well-designed app icon
- [x] Human-friendly and UTI-aware type names
- [x] Automatic refresh
- [x] Renderers for HTML, RTF, and images
- [x] Syntax highlighting for source code
- [x] Quick Look integration
- [x] Faster hexadecimal viewer

Also, **WhatCopied** is an open-source project built with the latest Apple ecosystem technologies, unlike Apple's Clipboard Viewer, which has not been maintained for nearly a decade.

Hope you find this tool helpfulâ€”happy hacking!
